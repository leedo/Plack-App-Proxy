      client => sub {
          my $cb = shift;

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item test_proxy

  test_proxy app    => $app, 
             proxy  => $proxy_cb->($app_host, $app_port), 
             client => $client_cb->($cb);

=back

test_proxy runs two servers, 'C<app>' as an origin server and the proxy server.
In 'C<proxy>' callback, you should create the proxy server instance to send 
requests to 'C<app>' server. Then 'C<client>' callback is called to run your 
tests. In 'C<client>' callback, all HTTP requests are sent to 'C<proxy>' 
server. (And the proxy server will proxy your request to the app server.)
